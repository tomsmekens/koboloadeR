#' @title  Generate a report displaying disclosure risk for Statistical Disclosure Control
#'
#' @description  Automatically produce a disclosure risk measurement report.
#'
#'  The report is generated from functions released within sdcmicro package from the worldbank.
#'   https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/sdcMicro.pdf
#'
#'
#' @param  frame kobo or odk dataset to use
#' @param form The full filename of the form to be accessed (xls or xlsx file).
#' @param app The place where the function has been executed, the default is the console and the second option is the shiny app
